# Car-Prices-Detection-
 predicting the price of a car. Suppose that we have a website where people can sell and buy used cars. When posting an ad on our website, sellers often struggle to come up with a meaningful price. We want to help our users with automatic price recommendations. We ask the sellers to specify the model, make, year, mileage, and other important characteristics of a car, and based on that information, we want to suggest the best price.
